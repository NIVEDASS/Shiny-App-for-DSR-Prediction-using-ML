# Shiny-App-for-DSR-Prediction-using-ML

To find the best model, many regression methods were implemented including random forest, cubist, M5, support vector regression where 80% of the resampled data was used for training and the remaining 20% was used as test data. In order to make it easily accessible, all models were moved into a shiny application where the user can select the weather station (input dataset). The data tab shows the raw dataset of the user selected weather station, missing value plot, and the boxplot showing outliers. The split tab shows the train-test split where the user can customize the split i.e., users can select what percentage of data should be used for training and testing. The next tab shows the methods where the user can select one to train the model. Training the model takes longer time, hence the code was modified to save the model once the training is done, so next time when the user wants to use the model, the app directly loads it from the saved models folder. The summary of the model is displayed and performance metrics like root mean squared error (RMSE), Mean absolute error (MAE), R squared values are displayed. The performance tab allows us to compare the models and come to a conclusion for the best model.

The methods were chosen such that they had implicit feature selection capability and/or model specific variable importance metric as sensitivity analysis was major aim of this project.
